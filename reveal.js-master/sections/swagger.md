## What Problem Does it Solve?

* API Documentation
* Client Code Generation

## How Does it Work?

* The API provides a JSON file containing the OpenAPI specification.
* For easy publishing it can be provided directly by the API (f.ex.:
  `/swagger.json`
* Existing tools for humans:
  * [SwaggerUI][swaggerui]
  * [ReDoc][redoc]
